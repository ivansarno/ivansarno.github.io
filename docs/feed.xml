<p>I’m excited to announce that I have officially started my PhD this September at the University of Grenoble Alpes, in collaboration with CEA List/Leti and TIMA laboratories. My research is centered around the <strong>Secure Hardware/Software Implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography on RISC-V Platforms</strong>—a critical area as we prepare for the era of quantum computing.</p>

<p>This journey will allow me to continue pursuing my passion for Cryptography and Hardware Security. My focus will be on <strong>Post-Quantum Cryptography acceleration</strong>, which is essential to safeguarding future communication systems against the potential risks posed by quantum technologies.</p>

<p>In addition, I will deepen my understanding of <strong>RISC-V</strong>, an open-source hardware instruction set architecture, and explore techniques for <strong>side-channel-resistant design</strong> to build cryptographic systems resilient to physical attacks.</p>

<p>I’m thrilled to contribute to this rapidly evolving field and look forward to sharing updates as I progress through my research!</p>]]></content><author><name>Ivan Sarno</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Starting My PhD Journey at University of Grenoble Alpes, CEA, and TIMA Laboratories]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">CRYPHTOR: my first research paper</title><link href="https://ivansarno.github.io/2024/03/03/cryphtor.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="CRYPHTOR: my first research paper" /><published>2024-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-03-03T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://ivansarno.github.io/2024/03/03/%20cryphtor</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://ivansarno.github.io/2024/03/03/cryphtor.html"><![CDATA[<p>My first research paper has been published on IEEE Access! It derives from my master thesis and explores a mixed hardware/software approach to the acceleration of the Post-Quantum cryptographic algorithms Kyber and Dilithium. The project targets resource-constrained devices, so the hardware part accelerates only the polynomial computation; other sections of the algorithms are executed by the CPU. 
In addition, the similarities between the two algorithms are exploited to reuse as many resources as possible. The software reimplements the algorithms to take advantage of the accelerated operations and minimize I/O operations. This system has been implemented and tested on FPGA and RISC-V SoC.</p>
