title:  "CRYPHTOR: my first research paper"
---

My first research paper has been published on IEEE Access! It derives from my master thesis and explores a mixed hardware/software approach to the acceleration of the Post-Quantum cryptographic algorithms Kyber and Dilithium. The project targets resource-constrained devices, so the hardware part accelerates only the polynomial computation; other sections of the algorithms are executed by the CPU.Â 
In addition, the similarities between the two algorithms are exploited to reuse as many resources as possible. The software reimplements the algorithms to take advantage of the accelerated operations and minimize I/O operations. This system has been implemented and tested on FPGA and RISC-V SoC.
