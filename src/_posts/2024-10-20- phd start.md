### Starting My PhD Journey at University of Grenoble Alpes, CEA, and TIMA Laboratories

I’m excited to announce that I have officially started my PhD this September at the University of Grenoble Alpes, in collaboration with CEA List/Leti and TIMA laboratories. My research is centered around the **Secure Hardware/Software Implementation of Post-Quantum Cryptography on RISC-V Platforms**—a critical area as we prepare for the era of quantum computing.

This journey will allow me to continue pursuing my passion for Cryptography and Hardware Security. My focus will be on **Post-Quantum Cryptography acceleration**, which is essential to safeguarding future communication systems against the potential risks posed by quantum technologies.

In addition, I will deepen my understanding of **RISC-V**, an open-source hardware instruction set architecture, and explore techniques for **side-channel-resistant design** to build cryptographic systems resilient to physical attacks.

I’m thrilled to contribute to this rapidly evolving field and look forward to sharing updates as I progress through my research!
