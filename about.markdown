Areas of professional interest
------------------------------
My professional interests are Applied Cryptography, Cybersecurity and Secure HW/SW Systems Development.

Professional Experience
------------------------

From 2017 to 2020, I worked in the cryptocurrency sector in a small team with the aim of creating a new untraceable coin. 

My work consisted of the design and development of the secure and confidential money transaction system, implementing algorithms developed by team’s researchers, and return feedback to researchers on protocol development.

At the beginning of 2020, I left the team after finishing my work, when the team was still in stealth mode.

From this experience, I learned to work remotely, in a team of people from different nations, experts in various disciplines, to implements non-standard algorithms with mutual feedbacks with the research team that developed them.

Academic Education
------------------

Liceo Scientifico (Scientific High School) P.S. Mancini of Avellino

I attended high school at Liceo Scientifico P.S. Mancini of Avellino which gave me a solid scientific foundation and an Italian cultural background.

Extra activities:

Second year: Cinematography and Film Scripting course
Third year: cycle of seminars on relation between Mathematic and Philosophy 
Fourth year: cycle of seminars on modern Physic
Fifth year: Festival of Philosophy in Magna Grecia, a four-day event with lessons and laboratories about Philosophy
Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at the University of Pisa

I studied Computer Science at the University of Pisa, here I acquired a solid background in theoretical computer science and mathematics, I learned programming and software development and I became interested in Cryptography.

Key Courses: Cryptography, Cybersecurity, Computability and Complexity, Programming Experiences

My Bachelor thesis was about the consensus protocol of the Algorand blockchain. It analyses the protocol and its design choice and comment them in comparison with the landscape of consensus algorithm of the time.

Master Degree in Cybersecurity at the University of Pisa

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to go back to university to acquire a broader education about Cybersecurity, and then I enrolled in the new master’s degree course in Cybersecurity at the University of Pisa.

The master programme covered various aspects of security, as software, hardware, networking, organizational and legal, penetration testing and supply chain. All courses and exams ware in English. Almost every course included laboratory activities and practical projects, frequently in groups, in which I improved my team working skills. Here I started to learn hardware design and embedded systems.

During the master course I attended language courses provided by the university’s linguistic centre, I studied English from B2.1 to C1.1 level and French from A1 to A2 level.

My master thesis consists of porting the reference code of the recently standardised Kyber and Dilithium post-quantum encryption algorithms to Risc-V, and the design and implementation on FPGA of an accelerator for polynomial operations. The accelerator was developed using the SystemVerilog language and the Vivado suite, and targeting resource-limited devices.

Self Learning
-------------

Already during university, I invested heavily in independent training, very focused on specific arguments and oriented towards practice, reading many technical books, implementing algorithms and protocols, and experimenting with the knowledge acquired.

My training in Cryptography includes the study of the mathematical background, theoretical cryptography, applied cryptography, and secure implementation.All the cryptographic algorithms that I have implemented for learning purposes since 2014 are available on GitHub.

On the Software Development side, I remain updated with the latest versions of the languages that I use, the most modern techniques, patterns, and tools.

Culture
--------
I believe that a broad perspective on the world is an important quality today. For this reason, I read a lot of books on all kinds of subjects and newspapers from around the world. In particular, I like to read books about science, the base of modern thinking, philosophy, and history, to understand our society.

I am a tea lover. Tea is a drink that is widespread all over the world and deeply rooted in the cultures of the countries where it is drunk, cultures that I love to explore.

I am passionate about cinema and music since high school age. I studied electric bass at a private music school and double bass at the Domenico Cimarosa Conservatory during my high school years, and I performed with various bands in clubs and local festivals.
