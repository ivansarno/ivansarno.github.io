# # Welcome to Jekyll!
# #
# # This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# # which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# # yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# # feature for the data you need to update frequently.
# #
# # For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# # 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# # If you need help with YAML syntax, here are some quick references for you:

# # Site settings
# # These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# # you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# # You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# # in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.
